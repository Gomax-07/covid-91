## DESCRITION

The first case of COVID-19 was reported on December 1, 2019. The cause was a new type of coronavirus at the time, which was later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV2- may have originated in animals and has undergone changes (mutations), so it can cause disease in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks have been linked to viruses that originate in birds, pigs, bats, and other animals. These viruses mutate and pose a danger to humans. Research continues and more studies may reveal how and why the coronavirus has evolved to cause a pandemic.
